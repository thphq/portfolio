# Why Product Managers Should Think Like Comedians

Product management and stand-up comedy might seem like completely different worlds, but they share more similarities than you'd expect. Both require understanding your audience, perfect timing, and the ability to recover gracefully when things don't go as planned.

## Reading the Room: Understanding Your Audience

Just like a comedian needs to read their audience, product managers must deeply understand their users. A joke that kills in one venue might fall flat in another, and similarly, a feature that works for one user segment might confuse another.

### The Art of User Empathy

Comedians spend years learning to read micro-expressions, energy levels, and crowd dynamics. Product managers need similar skills:

- **Micro-feedback**: Pay attention to small user behaviors and feedback
- **Context Awareness**: Understand the environment your users operate in
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognize the emotional state of your users

### Testing Material

Comedians test new material in smaller venues before taking it to bigger stages. Product managers should:

- **A/B Test Features**: Test with smaller user groups first
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine based on user response
- **Know When to Kill**: Sometimes a feature just doesn't work

## Timing is Everything

In comedy, timing can make or break a joke. In product management, timing can make or break a product launch.

### Market Timing

- **Know Your Market Cycle**: Launch when the market is ready
- **Competitive Landscape**: Time your moves relative to competitors
- **User Readiness**: Ensure users are ready for your solution

### Feature Release Timing

- **User Journey Alignment**: Release features when users need them
- **Technical Readiness**: Don't rush incomplete features
- **Business Alignment**: Align with business goals and metrics

## The Setup and Punchline

Every good joke has a setup and a punchline. Every good product has a problem and a solution.

### Crafting the Setup (Problem Definition)

- **Make it Relatable**: Users should immediately understand the problem
- **Build Tension**: Help users feel the pain point
- **Create Anticipation**: Make them want the solution

### Delivering the Punchline (Solution)

- **Surprise and Delight**: The solution should be elegant and unexpected
- **Clear Value**: The benefit should be immediately obvious
- **Memorable**: Users should remember and talk about it

## Handling Hecklers: Dealing with Difficult Stakeholders

Every comedian faces hecklers, and every product manager faces difficult stakeholders.

### Strategies for Both

- **Stay Calm**: Don't let emotions take over
- **Acknowledge Concerns**: Show you've heard them
- **Redirect**: Bring focus back to the main point
- **Use Humor**: Sometimes levity can defuse tension

## The Callback: Building on Previous Success

Comedians use callbacks to reference earlier jokes and create continuity. Product managers should build on previous successes.

### Product Callbacks

- **Feature Consistency**: New features should feel familiar
- **Brand Continuity**: Maintain consistent user experience
- **Success Building**: Build on what already works

## Bombing Gracefully: Learning from Failure

Every comedian bombs sometimes, and every product manager launches features that fail.

### Recovery Strategies

- **Own the Failure**: Don't make excuses
- **Learn Quickly**: Understand what went wrong
- **Pivot Fast**: Adjust your approach
- **Keep the Audience**: Don't lose user trust

## The Long Game: Building Your Set

Comedians develop their "set" over years, refining and perfecting their material. Product managers build their product portfolio similarly.

### Building Your Product Set

- **Core Material**: Have reliable features that always work
- **New Material**: Continuously innovate and experiment
- **Know Your Strengths**: Play to your product's strengths
- **Evolve**: Adapt to changing user needs and market conditions

## Conclusion: The Show Must Go On

Both comedy and product management are about serving your audience, creating value, and continuously improving your craft. The skills are surprisingly transferable:

- **Empathy and Understanding**: Know your audience deeply
- **Timing and Rhythm**: Launch and iterate at the right pace
- **Resilience**: Bounce back from failures quickly
- **Continuous Learning**: Always refine your approach

The next time you're struggling with a product decision, think like a comedian. What would make your users laugh, think, or feel delighted? Sometimes the best product insights come from the most unexpected places.

# Why I Chose Vernacular Over English for Khambee

When we started building Khambee, the most important decision we made wasn't about technology, features, or business models. It was about language. In a country where 90% of the population is more comfortable in their native language, we chose to build India's first vernacular teaching platform. Here's why that decision changed everything.

## The English Bias in Indian Tech

### The Uncomfortable Truth

Despite India's linguistic diversity, most educational technology platforms are built with an English-first approach. This creates an invisible barrier that excludes millions of potential users and educators.

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- Only 10% of Indians are comfortable with English
- 600M+ Indians prefer consuming content in vernacular languages
- 90% of new internet users in India are vernacular-first
- Yet 95% of EdTech platforms are English-centric

### Why This Bias Exists

**Historical Reasons:**
- Colonial legacy of English as the "educated" language
- Urban elite building products for urban elite
- English seen as a marker of quality and sophistication
- International market aspirations driving English-first thinking

**Technical Reasons:**
- Easier to build in English (fonts, keyboards, processing)
- Limited vernacular content creation tools
- Lack of vernacular-speaking developers
- International frameworks and libraries are English-centric

**Business Reasons:**
- Investors more comfortable with English products
- Easier to scale internationally
- Higher perceived value and pricing power
- Simpler marketing and positioning

## The Vernacular Opportunity

# The $5M Feature: How SMS Changed Everything at Hubzu

Sometimes the most impactful features are the simplest ones. During my time at Hubzu, a real estate auction platform, I implemented what seemed like a basic SMS notification system. That "simple" feature ended up generating over $5M in additional annual revenue and taught me one of the most important lessons in product management: meet users where they are, not where you think they should be.

## The Context: Real Estate Auctions in 2018

### Understanding Hubzu

Hubzu was a pioneering online real estate auction platform where banks and asset management companies could auction foreclosed properties. The platform served two main user groups:

**Sellers (Banks/AMCs):**
- Needed to liquidate foreclosed properties quickly
- Wanted maximum participation to drive up prices
- Required transparent, compliant auction processes
- Measured success by sale price and time to sale

**Buyers (Real Estate Investors):**
- Professional investors and individual buyers
- Needed real-time updates on auction status
- Made time-sensitive bidding decisions
- Often managed multiple simultaneous auctions

### The Problem We Discovered

Despite having a functional web platform and email notifications, we were seeing concerning patterns:

**Low Engagement Metrics:**
- 40% of registered bidders never placed a bid
- 60% of active auctions had fewer than 5 bidders
- Average auction participation was declining month-over-month
- Customer support was flooded with "I missed the auction" complaints

**Revenue Impact:**
- Lower participation meant lower final sale prices
- Sellers were questioning the platform's effectiveness
- Buyer retention was declining
- Customer acquisition costs were increasing

## The Investigation: Understanding User Behavior

### Primary Research

I conducted extensive research to understand why engagement was low despite having email notifications and a mobile-responsive website.

**Buyer Interviews (50+ participants):**
- How they tracked auction progress
- Communication preferences
- Pain points in the current process
- Technology usage patterns

**Behavioral Analysis:**
- Email open rates: 25% (industry average: 20%)
- Website visit frequency during active auctions
- Mobile vs. desktop usage patterns
- Time-of-day activity analysis

### The Surprising Insights

**Mobile-First Reality:**
- 70% of users primarily accessed Hubzu on mobile
- But mobile engagement was significantly lower than desktop
- Users found the mobile web experience cumbersome for quick updates
- Many users didn't have email notifications enabled on mobile

**Communication Preferences:**
- 85% of users preferred SMS for time-sensitive updates
- Users checked SMS within 3 minutes on average
- SMS had 98% open rate vs. 25% for email
- Users trusted SMS more for urgent notifications

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Professional investors managed 10-20 simultaneous auctions
- They needed instant updates to make quick decisions
- Many were in meetings or on-site during auction hours
- Quick glances at phone were preferred over opening apps/emails

**The Key Insight:**
Users weren't ignoring our platform—they were missing critical updates because we weren't communicating through their preferred channel.

## Conclusion: The Power of Meeting Users Where They Are

The $5M SMS feature at Hubzu taught me that sometimes the most impactful product decisions aren't about building something new—they're about understanding your users deeply and meeting them where they are, not where you think they should be.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **User Research is Non-Negotiable**: Deep understanding of user behavior and preferences drives impactful decisions
2. **Simple Solutions Can Have Massive Impact**: Don't overlook basic technologies that solve real problems
3. **Communication Channel Matters**: The same information delivered through the right channel can be exponentially more effective
4. **Measure What Matters**: Focus on business impact and user outcomes, not just technical metrics
5. **Iterate Based on Real Usage**: User behavior in production is more valuable than user feedback in research

The feature that generated $5M in additional revenue wasn't revolutionary technology—it was a simple SMS system that solved a real problem for real users in their real context.

This experience fundamentally changed how I approach product management: always start with the user's context, challenge your assumptions about what they need, and remember that the best solution is often the simplest one that actually works.

    excerpt: "From managing a team of 8 at Adrokart to leading 50+ members at Khambee - the mistakes, the learnings, and the moments that shaped my leadership philosophy.",
    content: `
# Leading 50+ People Before 30: Lessons from Building Teams at Scale

Leadership isn't about age—it's about impact. By 30, I had the privilege of leading teams of 50+ people across different organizations, from scrappy startups to established enterprises. Here's what I learned about building, managing, and scaling teams that deliver results.

## The Foundation: Trust Before Authority

When I became Chief Coordinator at NITK's Tech Fest, managing a team of 50+ volunteers, I quickly realized that authority on paper means nothing without trust in practice. The first lesson was simple but profound: **people follow leaders they trust, not titles they respect**.

### Building Trust at Scale

- **Transparency in Decision Making**: I started sharing the 'why' behind every major decision
- **Admitting Mistakes Early**: When our sponsorship strategy wasn't working, I openly discussed it with the team
- **Celebrating Others' Wins**: The ₹30L+ sponsorship success belonged to the team, not me

## The Challenge: From Individual Contributor to Team Builder

Transitioning from doing the work to enabling others to do the work is one of the hardest shifts in leadership. At Khambee, as we scaled from 5 to 40+ team members, I had to learn this lesson repeatedly.

### The Delegation Framework I Developed

1. **Context Setting**: Explain the bigger picture
2. **Clear Outcomes**: Define success metrics
3. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure they have what they need
4. **Check-in Cadence**: Regular but not micromanaging
5. **Recognition System**: Celebrate wins publicly

## Managing Diverse Teams: The NITK Experience

Leading the Entrepreneurship Cell at NITK taught me about managing diverse personalities, skills, and motivations. With 50+ members from different engineering backgrounds, the challenge was creating unity while leveraging diversity.

### The Three Pillars of Diverse Team Management

**1. Inclusive Communication**
- Weekly all-hands meetings with rotating presenters
- Anonymous feedback systems
- Multiple communication channels (formal meetings, Slack, informal coffee chats)

**2. Skill-Based Task Allocation**
- Mapped each member's strengths and interests
- Created cross-functional project teams
- Implemented mentorship pairs

**3. Shared Purpose**
- Clearly articulated our mission: "Democratizing entrepreneurship on campus"
- Connected individual contributions to larger impact
- Regular success story sharing

## Scaling Challenges: The Startup Reality

At Khambee, scaling from a small founding team to 40+ members brought unique challenges:

### The Growing Pains

- **Communication Breakdown**: What worked for 10 people failed at 25
- **Culture Dilution**: Our startup culture was getting lost
- **Decision Bottlenecks**: I was becoming the constraint

### Solutions That Worked

**Implemented Structured Communication**
- Daily standups for core teams
- Weekly cross-team syncs
- Monthly all-hands with transparent metrics sharing

**Preserved Culture Through Systems**
- Documented our values and decision-making principles
- Created onboarding programs that emphasized culture
- Established culture champions across teams

**Distributed Decision Making**
- Defined clear decision-making authorities
- Created escalation paths
- Implemented OKRs for alignment

## The Numbers Game: Managing Performance at Scale

Leading large teams means you can't manage everyone individually. You need systems, metrics, and frameworks.

### Performance Management Framework

**Individual Level**
- Quarterly goal setting aligned with company OKRs
- Monthly one-on-ones focused on growth and blockers
- 360-degree feedback every six months

**Team Level**
- Weekly team health metrics
- Sprint retrospectives with action items
- Cross-team collaboration scores

**Organizational Level**
- Employee satisfaction surveys
- Retention and promotion tracking
- Leadership pipeline development

## Crisis Leadership: The Perpule Experience

During my time at Perpule (later acquired by Amazon), leading the growth team of 7 FTEs and 4 interns during the early pandemic taught me about crisis leadership.

### Crisis Leadership Principles

1. **Over-communicate**: In uncertainty, more communication is better
2. **Make Fast Decisions**: Perfect information doesn't exist in crisis
3. **Support Your Team**: Focus on their well-being first
4. **Adapt Quickly**: What worked yesterday might not work today

## The Emotional Side: Dealing with Difficult Conversations

Leading large teams means having difficult conversations regularly—performance issues, team conflicts, strategic pivots, and sometimes, letting people go.

### My Framework for Difficult Conversations

**Preparation**
- Gather facts, not opinions
- Understand the other person's perspective
- Define the desired outcome

**Execution**
- Start with empathy and context
- Be direct but respectful
- Focus on behaviors and impact, not personality
- Collaborate on solutions

**Follow-up**
- Document agreements
- Set clear timelines
- Schedule check-ins
- Provide necessary support

## Building Future Leaders: The Multiplication Effect

The best leaders create more leaders. At every organization, I focused on developing the next generation of leaders.

### Leadership Development Strategies

**Mentorship Programs**
- Paired senior and junior team members
- Structured learning paths
- Regular feedback sessions

**Stretch Assignments**
- Gave high-potential team members challenging projects
- Provided safety net while allowing autonomy
- Celebrated both successes and learning from failures

**Knowledge Sharing**
- Regular leadership workshops
- Book clubs focused on management and leadership
- Cross-functional project rotations

## Lessons Learned: What I'd Do Differently

### Mistakes I Made

1. **Promoted Too Fast**: Sometimes promoted based on technical skills rather than leadership potential
2. **Avoided Difficult Conversations**: Delayed addressing performance issues
3. **Micromanaged During Stress**: Reverted to doing rather than leading during high-pressure situations

### What I'd Do Differently

1. **Invest More in Leadership Training**: Both for myself and my team
2. **Create Better Feedback Loops**: More frequent and structured feedback
3. **Focus on Succession Planning**: Always have a plan for key roles

## The Impact: Measuring Leadership Success

Leadership success isn't just about hitting numbers—it's about the people you develop and the culture you create.

### My Leadership Metrics

**Quantitative**
- Team retention rates (maintained 85%+ across organizations)
- Promotion rates of team members (60%+ got promoted or advanced)
- Project success rates (90%+ of major initiatives delivered)

**Qualitative**
- Team satisfaction scores
- 360-degree feedback improvements
- Alumni network strength (many team members became leaders themselves)

## Looking Forward: Leadership in the Age of Remote Work

The future of leadership is changing. Remote and hybrid teams require different approaches to the traditional leadership playbook.

### Adapting Leadership for Modern Teams

**Digital-First Communication**
- Async communication as default
- Video calls for relationship building
- Digital collaboration tools mastery

**Results-Oriented Management**
- Focus on outcomes, not hours
- Clear deliverables and timelines
- Trust-based accountability

**Virtual Culture Building**
- Online team building activities
- Digital coffee chats and informal interactions
- Shared virtual experiences

## Key Takeaways for Aspiring Leaders

1. **Start with Self-Awareness**: Understand your leadership style and blind spots
2. **Invest in Relationships**: Leadership is fundamentally about people
3. **Create Systems**: You can't scale without processes and frameworks
4. **Embrace Continuous Learning**: Leadership skills need constant development
5. **Focus on Impact**: Measure success by the growth of your team and organization

## The Journey Continues

Leading 50+ people before 30 taught me that leadership is not a destination—it's a continuous journey of learning, adapting, and growing. Every team, every challenge, and every success adds to your leadership toolkit.

The most rewarding part isn't the titles or recognition—it's seeing the people you've led go on to achieve great things themselves. That's the true measure of leadership success.
